# Code of Conduct

We are committed to a welcoming, harassment-free community. By participating, you agree to:

- Be respectful and inclusive
- Use welcoming and inclusive language
- Accept constructive feedback gracefully
- Focus on what is best for the community

Unacceptable behavior includes harassment, discrimination, and personal attacks. Report incidents to the maintainers via security contact in SECURITY.md.

We may adapt the enforcement ladder (informal warning → official warning → temporary ban → permanent ban) depending on severity.
