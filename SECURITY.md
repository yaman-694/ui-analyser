# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do not file public issues for security vulnerabilities. Instead, email the maintainers with details so we can triage and fix promptly.

Include:
- Affected component (frontend, api, agent)
- Steps to reproduce
- Impact assessment
- Suggested remediation (if known)

We will acknowledge within 3 business days and aim to release a fix as soon as feasible.

## Supported Versions

We support the latest main branch. For critical vulnerabilities, we may backport at the maintainers' discretion.
